# Database Persistence Features

## Overview

The AI Rota System now includes comprehensive SQLite database persistence to ensure that all data, assignments, and operations are maintained across application restarts. This ensures users never lose their work when the application is restarted or updated.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **`employees`** - Stores all employee data
2. **`patients`** - Stores all patient data  
3. **`assignments`** - Stores all employee-patient assignments
4. **`operations_log`** - Stores all system operations and activities
5. **`data_uploads`** - Stores upload history and metadata

### Database Location

- **File**: `/app/data/rota_operations.db`
- **Host Mount**: `./data/rota_operations.db`
- **Persistence**: Data survives container restarts and updates

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Upload Process
1. User uploads Excel file via `/upload-data`
2. Data is processed and stored in memory
3. **NEW**: Data is automatically persisted to SQLite database
4. Upload metadata is logged to `data_uploads` table

### Application Startup
1. Application starts
2. **NEW**: Database is checked for existing data
3. **NEW**: Employees and patients are loaded from database
4. **NEW**: Previous assignments are restored from database
5. System is ready with all previous data intact

### Assignment Process
1. User creates assignment via `/assign-employee`
2. Assignment is created in memory
3. **NEW**: Assignment is automatically saved to database
4. **NEW**: Operation is logged to `operations_log` table

## 📊 New API Endpoints

### Data Status
```bash
GET /data-status
```
Returns current system status including:
- `has_data`: Whether data is loaded
- `employees_count`: Number of employees
- `patients_count`: Number of patients  
- `assignments_count`: Number of current assignments
- `database_has_data`: Whether database contains data

### Database Operations
```bash
# Get employees from database
GET /database/employees

# Get patients from database  
GET /database/patients

# Get all assignments from database
GET /database/assignments

# Get operation logs
GET /database/logs

# Get upload history
GET /database/uploads
```

### Data Management
```bash
# Clear all data (for testing/reset)
POST /database/clear

# Reload data from database into memory
POST /database/reload
```

## 🛡️ Data Persistence Features

### Automatic Persistence
- ✅ **Employee Data**: Automatically saved when uploaded
- ✅ **Patient Data**: Automatically saved when uploaded
- ✅ **Assignments**: Automatically saved when created
- ✅ **Operations**: All operations are logged with timestamps
- ✅ **Upload History**: Complete history of all data uploads

### Cross-Restart Persistence
- ✅ **Container Restarts**: Data survives Docker container restarts
- ✅ **Application Updates**: Data persists through code updates
- ✅ **System Reboots**: Data survives host system reboots
- ✅ **Volume Mounts**: Data is stored in persistent Docker volumes

### Data Integrity
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: All database operations use transactions
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Failed operations are logged and handled gracefully
- ✅ **Data Validation**: All data is validated before storage
- ✅ **Backup Ready**: SQLite file can be easily backed up

## 🔧 Configuration

### Docker Volume
The database is automatically mounted as a Docker volume:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data
```

### Database File
- **Location**: `/app/data/rota_operations.db`
- **Size**: ~45KB (with current data)
- **Backup**: Can be copied directly for backup

## 📈 Benefits

### For Users
- **No Data Loss**: All work is preserved across restarts
- **Continuous Operation**: System maintains state between sessions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all operations
- **Reliability**: Data is safely stored and recoverable

### For Administrators
- **Easy Backup**: Single SQLite file to backup
- **Monitoring**: Complete logs of all system activities
- **Debugging**: Detailed operation history for troubleshooting
- **Scalability**: Database can handle thousands of records

### For Developers
- **State Management**: Automatic state restoration on startup
- **Testing**: Easy to reset data with `/database/clear`
- **Development**: Local data persists during development
- **Deployment**: Data survives deployment updates

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Check System Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/data-status
```

### View Upload History
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/database/uploads
```

### View All Assignments
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/database/assignments
```

### Clear All Data (Testing)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/database/clear
```

### Reload from Database
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/database/reload
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Database Size
```bash
ls -lh data/rota_operations.db
```

### Table Counts
```bash
# Check employees
curl http://localhost:8000/database/employees | grep -o '"employee_id"' | wc -l

# Check patients  
curl http://localhost:8000/database/patients | grep -o '"patient_id"' | wc -l

# Check assignments
curl http://localhost:8000/database/assignments | grep -o '"employee_id"' | wc -l
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
1. **Check database file exists**: `ls -la data/`
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure Docker has write access
3. **Check volume mount**: Verify Docker volume is mounted correctly

### Data Loading Issues
1. **Check data status**: `curl http://localhost:8000/data-status`
2. **Reload from database**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/database/reload`
3. **Check logs**: `curl http://localhost:8000/database/logs`

### Reset System
1. **Clear all data**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/database/clear`
2. **Upload fresh data**: Use the upload interface
3. **Verify data**: Check data status endpoint
